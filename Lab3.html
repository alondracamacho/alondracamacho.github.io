                <h1>My Thoughts</h1>
                <p>It's safe to say that the prequel trilogy has an obvious unfair advantage 
                    to episodes 4 - 6, the higher production quality. I would also say that 
                    the plot of the first trilogy is a bit more dramatic, which made it easy 
                    for me to watch on the first-go. The newer trilogy seemed to have leeched onto 
                    any originality from the first 2 trilogies and lacked any excitement that 
                    the first 6 films had(Dont even get me started on The Rise of Skywalker. That 
                    was probably THE WORST one released).</p>

                <p>Anyway, I personally felt that the third episode EASILY outshined any of the other 
                    films, and I will NOT be changing my mind on this. Below are some of my many reasons 
                    for feeling this way:
