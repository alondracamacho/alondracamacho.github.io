       <h3>About me: </h3> 
       <p>I am in my fourth semester at CSI and I am also part of the Macaulay Honors Program. Up until now, I have been on a Chemistry track, 
        meaning that I have taken classes such as: </p>
      
        <ul>
        <li>Gen Bio I and II w/ lab</li>
        <li>Gen Chem I and II w/ lab</li>
        <li>Cell Bio w/ lab</li>
        <li>Calc I and II</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        This semester, I am taking Calc 3, CSC 126, and CSC 225. I am hoping that by the end of the semester, I switch to being a Computer Science major, or 
        at least find something relating to it that I'm interested in. Some things I do for fun include crocheting, embroidery, and bracelet making(similar to 
        the ones shown in the image below). I have played the violin for 6 years and I'm an amateur guitar player.</p>

        <h3>Past Projects: </h3> 
        <p>During the summer of 2019, I participlated in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. Here, I was introduced to some coding languages, 
            although it's been a while since I last looked at them. At the end of the program, I did a group project where we made a web game using html, css, 
            and javascript. The game discussed issues regarding the pollution of our oceans, and had players control a fish who was supposed to collect food while 
            avoiding obstacles, such as plastic, cans, and other sorts of trash. The game is really out of date and the code has been tampered with ever since, so I hope 
            that one day I could go back to fix these bugs, and overall improve the quality of the game. From 2018 to 2021, I made a few projects using open data sources, Excel, 
            and QGIS to make maps. These maps were used to identify local community challenges to raise awareness and to formulate potential solutions to these issues.
